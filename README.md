## About
We set out to answer the question what if we could generate additional returns from the NFTs we already own?
ZooDAO responds directly to this question, by creating an ecosystem in which NFTs may be used to work for users, generating returns on existing investments passively.
### Greater purposes for NFTs

* Cross-community interaction in a gamified environment
* A user-friendly on-ramp to DeFi for an ever growing community of 205'000 NFT holders
* The capability to leverage digital assets to earn additional income without the possibility of liquidation or loss


## NFT Battles
##### NftBattleArena is time-based cyclic contracts with five stages in each epoch.


* 1st stage: Staking and unstaking of nfts, claiming rewards from previous epochs.
* 2nd stage: Voting for nft with stablecoins
* 3rd stage: Pairing of nft for battle.
* 4th stage: Boosting\voting for nft with LPs, which contain Zoo
* 5th stage: Random request and Choosing winners in pair.

## Technology
ZooDAO uses several technologies to provide its services:

- **Aragon**: ZooDAO integrates Aragon to provide true autonomy and fairness to the DAO.
- **DeFi protocols**: ZooDAO builds on DeFi protocols to deliver users organic yield, which underpins their rewards.


## Deploy
Deploying with Brownie involves a few steps:

**Install Brownie**: You can install Brownie using pip, which is Python's package manager. You can do this by typing the following in your terminal:
```bash
pip install eth-brownie
```
Here are some steps to deploy ZooDAO based on the information available:

**Running Scripts**: The `brownie run <script> [function]` command is used to execute a script from the command line in the Brownie Python development environment. Here's a breakdown of the command:
```bash
brownie run <script> [function]
```
## Testing
To run a test script in Brownie, you can use the `brownie test` command followed by the path to your test script. For example:

```bash
brownie test tests/test_simple_incentive_rewards.py
```

If you want to run a specific test function within a test script, you can do so by appending `::` followed by the function name to the script path. For example:

```bash
brownie test tests/test_simple_incentive_rewards.py::test_no_rewards_after_finish_epoch
```

This will only execute the specified test function within the given test script.

You can also use the `--coverage` flag to see the coverage of your smart contract:

```bash
brownie test tests/test_simple_incentive_rewards.py --coverage
```

This command will run the tests and also provide a coverage report.


## Compile
To compile a ZooDAO project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Brownie**: If you haven't installed Brownie yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install eth-brownie
```

2. **Clone the ZooDAO repository**: Clone the ZooDAO repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone <ZooDAO GitHub repository URL>
```
Please replace `<ZooDAO GitHub repository URL>` with the actual URL of the ZooDAO repository.

3. **Navigate to your project directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your ZooDAO project.

4. **Install dependencies**: Install any dependencies that are required for the project. This is typically done by running `npm install` in your project directory.

5. **Compile the project**: The `brownie compile` command is used to compile your smart contracts. Each time the compiler runs, Brownie compares hashes of each contract source against hashes of the existing compiled versions. If a contract has not changed it is not recompiled.
```bash
brownie compile
```
If you wish to force a recompile of the entire project, you can use `brownie compile --all`.
```bash
brownie compile --all
```
6. **Review the results**: If the compilation is successful, you should see a message indicating that the compilation was successful. If there are any errors, they will be displayed in the terminal.
